   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the directory and add:
   ```bash
   PORT = 3000

## üß© Troubleshooting

### 1. MongoDB Connection Fails
- Ensure your `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file is correct.
- Make sure your MongoDB Atlas cluster is active.
- Verify that your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas.

### 2. Server Crashes on Start
- Run `npm install` to make sure all dependencies are installed.
- Check that your `.env` file exists and contains valid values.
- Look at the terminal error for missing or misconfigured modules.

### 3. Sessions Not Persisting
- Confirm that `connect-mongo` is installed and used in Express session middleware.
- Make sure your MongoDB URI is correctly used for session storage.
- Check for errors in the MongoDB session store connection.

### 4. CSS or Pages Not Loading
- Ensure static assets are served correctly from the `public` directory.
- Make sure Handlebars views are correctly placed in the `views/` directory.
- Double-check relative paths in HTML and layout templates.

### 5. Seed Script Not Working
- Confirm MongoDB is connected when running `npm run seed`.
- Check the seed script for hardcoded values that may conflict with your data.
